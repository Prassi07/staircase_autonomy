# Staircase Autonomy

This repository contains the ROS 2 implementation for a staircase perception and modeling pipeline. The algorithms in this work are designed to enable autonomous robots to reliably detect, model, and traverse staircases using 3D point cloud data.

---

## Overview

This package implements and merges the work from two research papers. The core functionality includes:

1.  [**Fast Staircase Detection and Multi-Robot Merging (ICRA 2023):**](https://www.prassi.me/fast-staircase-detection) A computationally efficient method for detecting staircases from 3D point clouds. It relies on extracting line segments from a pre-processed point cloud and applying a set of geometric constraints to identify potential stair structures. This approach also includes a method for merging detections from multiple viewpoints or robots to create a more complete estimate of the staircase.

2.  [**Bayesian Modeling and Inference for Cluttered Staircases (RA-L 2025):**](https://www.prassi.me/bayesian-staircase-estimation) A probabilistic framework that improves staircase estimation, especially in cluttered scenes where stairs might be partially obscured. This method uses a Bayesian model to combine measurements (detections) using an Extended Kalman Filter. We can then segment points on stair surfaces usin the estimated staircase location.

## Quick Start

### Installation

This package has been fully tested with ROS2 Humble. To build the packages, clone this repository into your ROS 2 workspace and build it using colcon:

```
cd your_ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/prassi07/staircase_autonomy.git
cd ..
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to staircase_perception
source install/setup.bash
```

### Staircase Estimation (Single and Multi-Robot)
You can launch the robot staircase estimation node as shown below. The node takes in Odometry and Registered Point Clouds from SLAM as input and detects, models and estimates staircases. The estimated staircases can be visualized in RViz2. 

```
ros2 launch staircase_perception staircase_estimation_robot_nodes.launch.py robot_namespace:=/robot_A launch_marker_publisher:=true
```

If you have a multi-robot setup, you can launch the above node on each of the robots and aggregate estimates. On an off-robot machine with communications to the robot, you can run the client node that can merge esimates from multiple robots.

```
ros2 launch staircase_perception staircase_client_nodes.launch.py 
```

### Standalone Staircase Detection
If you do not have registered point clouds and want to run just the detection pipeline without merging, you can use raw pointclouds from a Zed 2i/Intel Realsense camera using the standalone ros node. First launch the standalone detection node. 

```
ros2 launch staircase_perception staircase_standalone_detection_node.launch.py 
```

**NOTE**: This node expects that camera is aligned w.r.t to gravity, i.e., the z-axis (ROS2 convention) is pointing up in the opposite direction of gravity (0-roll and 0-pitch). If the camera pitches, detections might not occur.
